## ⚠️ Limitations and Warnings

**Please read carefully before using JotPad in its current development stage.**

- **Offline-First Only**  
  JotPad is designed as an offline-first application. At this time, there is **no** built-in synchronization between devices or platforms. All your notes are stored locally on the device where they were created.

- **Not for Critical Data**  
  Because JotPad is still under active development, unexpected bugs or crashes may occur. We **strongly** recommend **not** using JotPad to store irreplaceable or mission-critical information until synchronization and stability have been fully implemented and tested.

- **Potential Data Loss**  
  As features evolve, database schema changes or unanticipated errors could lead to data loss. Please export or back up your notes regularly (e.g., via JSON, TXT, or Markdown export) to safeguard your content.

- **Cross-Platform Testing Incomplete**  
  While JotPad aims to run on Web, Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and Mobile (Android, iOS), not every combination of device, browser or OS has been exhaustively tested. You may encounter layout issues, performance quirks, or platform-specific bugs.

- **Feedback Welcome**  
  Your input helps us improve. If you experience any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub describing the problem, your environment, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

Thank you for trying JotPad during its early stages. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards a robust, fully synchronized note-taking experience! 🚀
